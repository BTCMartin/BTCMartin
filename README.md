Hi, I am Burton Trent Country Music and my real name is Martin hence the BTCMartin
I am interested in researching how to get Smart Wiring in my 12 metre bus project to go touring doing Country Music .
At present I have bought some RGB and WW CW LED Strip lights to add ambience inside my bus for the kitchen & Loungs area's.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on strip lighting i.e. I received a SP511E but they did not send any connections for the strip to join to it?
- Maybe that is becuase the RGB strips are not compatible with the SP511E 3 pin white connectors on it. My strips have 4x pin.
You can email me @ burtontrentcountrymusic@gmail.com or burtontrent@hotmail.com
Its good fun doing out my second bus now, but 12 metres is a large project for me.
